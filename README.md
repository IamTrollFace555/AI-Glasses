# AI-Glasses
AI powered glasses aimed to assist blind or partially blind people in their day to day activities.


1. Object Detection:

* Research and choose an appropriate object detection framework (e.g., YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN).
* Collect and preprocess a diverse dataset of images for training the object detection model.
* Train the object detection model on the dataset using GPU resources.
* Optimize the trained model for real-time performance on the glasses.
* Integrate the object detection model into the glasses' software pipeline.
* Test the object detection functionality in various real-world scenarios and refine as necessary.

3. Virtual Assistant:

* Research and select a suitable Natural Language Processing (NLP) model (e.g., GPT, BERT).
* Fine-tune the chosen NLP model on a corpus of conversational data and task-specific commands.
* Implement a dialogue management system to handle conversations and execute commands.
* Develop mechanisms for the virtual assistant to access and interact with other system components (e.g., object detection, reminders).
* Integrate the virtual assistant into the glasses' software architecture.
* Conduct thorough testing and debugging of the virtual assistant's capabilities.

3. Physical Interface:

* Design the physical form factor of the glasses, considering ergonomics and usability.
* Prototype the physical interface components, including buttons, touch panels, or gesture recognition sensors.
* Develop the electronic circuitry to connect the interface components to the glasses' mainboard.
* Implement firmware to manage user inputs and control the glasses' functionalities.
* Conduct user testing and iterate on the design based on feedback.
* Finalize the physical interface design for mass production.

4. Cloud:

* Choose a cloud service provider and set up an account.
* Design the cloud architecture to host AI models, handle communication with the glasses, and store user data securely.
* Select a suitable database technology for storing user data (e.g., SQL, NoSQL).
* Develop a schema for the database to organize and manage user information efficiently.
* Implement mechanisms for securely storing and accessing user data, including encryption and access control.
* Integrate the database into the cloud infrastructure, ensuring compatibility with other system components.
* Implement backup and disaster recovery procedures to safeguard user data against loss or corruption.
* Conduct thorough testing of the cloud infrastructure, including scalability, reliability, and security.
* Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations and user privacy preferences.
* Document the cloud architecture and procedures for future maintenance and updates.

5. Phone:

* Select a mobile development framework (e.g., Flutter, React Native).
* Design the user interface for the mobile app to communicate with the glasses and cloud server.
* Implement communication protocols (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, REST API) between the glasses and mobile app.
* Integrate features for configuring settings, managing notifications, and accessing additional functionalities.
* Conduct extensive testing on different mobile devices and operating systems.
* Publish the mobile app on relevant app stores and ensure compatibility with future updates.
